## Overview

The **Java Snake Game** is a classic implementation of the popular Snake game in Java. It provides a fun way to learn game development concepts and improve your Java skills.

## Features

- Control the snake using arrow keys (up, down, left, and right).
- Eat food (represented by dots) to grow longer and score points.
- Avoid collisions with walls and the snake's own body.
- Randomly generated food positions.

## Implementation Details

- Graphics: The game likely uses Java's Swing or JavaFX libraries for rendering.
- Data Structure: A linked list or similar structure represents the snake's body segments.
- Collision Detection: Ensures the snake doesn't collide with walls or itself.
- Food Generation: Food positions are randomly generated.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Compile the Java source files.
3. Run the game.

## Controls

- Arrow keys: Move the snake (up, down, left, right).
